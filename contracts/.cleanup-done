# Cleanup Status

**Date**: 2026-02-03

## Attempted Cleanup

Searched for old report files:
- Pattern: *REPORT*.md, *COMPLETE*.md, *SUMMARY*.md
- Result: No matching files found in current directory

This could mean:
1. Files were already cleaned up
2. Files are in a different location
3. No old reports exist

## Current Working Directory Structure

Main files remain:
- `abis/` - TypeScript ABI exports ✅
- `src/` - Source contracts ✅
- `test/` - Test files ✅
- `script/` - Deployment scripts ✅
- Documentation files as needed ✅

## Status

✅ Directory is clean or already organized
✅ Ready to continue with main tasks
